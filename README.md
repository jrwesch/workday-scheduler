# workday-scheduler
## Description

Given some starter code that laid out the basic visual of the project, I was tasked with building functionality to the application. I was to use APIs and work deeper on JavaScript. The given user story was: <br/>

AS AN employee with a busy schedule</br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner</br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively</br>

The acceptance criteria were:<br/>

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule</br>
WHEN I open the planner</br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar</br>
WHEN I scroll down</br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours</br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day</br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future</br>
WHEN I click into a time block</br>
THEN I can enter an event</br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block</br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage</br>
WHEN I refresh the page</br>
THEN the saved events persist</br>

The application works as requested. 


## Site Preview

## Usage

The app functions as it should so it can be used as a simple scheduler. As of yet there is no way to export the data saved so the user would have to keep this particular tab open to use use it.
